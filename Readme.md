# Raspberry Pi USB product ID list

## Allocation
The USB-IF have given Raspberry Pi permission to sub-license the USB product ID values for it's vendor ID (0x2E8A) since they are to be used on a common silicon component which will be used within a customer's product (the RP2040 silicon).  For each of the allocations we (Raspberry Pi) will have to apply to the USB-IF to agree this use.  This document then contains the full list of product IDs we have approved.

## Assignment

To create an assignment, go to the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaAkcxVD5xSgf-vFdZe7URqDeUhAo9Vx-17YZgtpXpeTHpVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) filling in the relevant information.  If you would like to reserve an allocation before making a new product public, select that option and email info@raspberrypi.org to request activation of the allocation when you are ready to go public (failure to do this will mean losing the allocation).

Vendor-ID = 0x2E8A
